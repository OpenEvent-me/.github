OpenEvent is the open-source AI event discovery platform that powers your next favourite day out.

It's about about building and using free, open software to get you off your sofa, lose yourself in the mosh pit, spend a couple of bob at the bar and merch table, and have a lovely time supporting grass roots venues, artists, and people.

OpenEvent is free as in speech, and free as in beer.

We're working with venues, promoters, artists and—most importantly—punters to do this. We don't expect to make a penny from it, but if we put a smile on a single face, that's a success.
